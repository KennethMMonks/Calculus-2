\section{Series} While a sequence is a list of numbers, a series is a sum of a list of numbers.  That is, a sequence is a list of numbers with commas inbetween; a series is a list of numbers with plus signs inbetween.  We often use the very compact \emph{sigma notation} to represent series. 

\begin{definition}{Sigma Notation for Series}
If $a_n$ is a sequence and $j,k$ are both natural numbers, then we define the series:
$$\sum_{n=j}^k a_n =a_{j}+a_{j+1}+a_{j+2}+\cdots+a_{k}$$ That is, we add up all consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n$, starting at index $j$ and stopping at index $k$.
\end{definition}
Notice that the above summation has $k-j+1$ terms in it, not $k-j$ as one might quickly guess.  One way to see this is to rewrite the sum slightly as
$$a_{j}+a_{j+1}+a_{j+2}+\cdots+a_{k}=\underset{\text{One extra for term }0\ldots}{\underbrace{a_{j+0}}}+\underset{\text{\ldots then count terms }1,2,\ldots k}{\underbrace{a_{j+1}+a_{j+2}+\cdots+a_{k}}}.$$

This subtlety is often called an \emph{off by one error} or \emph{fencepost problem}, since one can view it as if the plus signs were sections of fence, and the terms in the sequence were posts holding up those sections.  To support $k-j$ sections of fence, we need $k-j+1$ posts, since each section has a post to the right of it, but the very first section of fence also has a post to the left which is not to the right of any section. 

If the starting index is greater than the stopping index, we consider the sum to be empty.  Since it has no terms, we define the total to be zero.  Thus, an \emph{empty sum} is the additive identity zero, just like an empty product is the multiplicative identity one.

The sequence $a_n$ that is being totaled is called the \emph{summand}, much as the function $f(x)$ is referred to as the integrand in the expression $\int f(x) \dif x$.

\begin{example}{Evaluating a Summation}
Consider the sum of all even numbers between six and fourteen.  Of course we don't need sigma notation to evaluate such a sum, but just for proof of  concept, let's write this sum in sigma notation, expand, and evaluate. 
\begin{itemize}
\item First we discuss the summand.  The sequence of all even numbers has the explicit formula $a_n=2n$, so $2n$ will be our summand.
\item We want the first term to be six, so we set $n=3$ as the starting index. 
\item We want the last term to be fourteen, so we set $n=7$ as the stopping index.

\end{itemize}

Thus our summation is 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=3}^{7}2n &= \underset{n=3}{\underbrace{6}}+\underset{n=4}{\underbrace{8}}+\underset{n=5}{\underbrace{10}}+\underset{n=6}{\underbrace{12}}+\underset{n=7}{\underbrace{14}} \\
 &= 60.
\end{align*}

\end{example}

\section{Arithmetic Series} If the \arithmeticsequence{summand} $a_n$ is an arithmetic sequence, the summation is called an \emph{arithmetic series}.  In this case, we have a nice \arithmeticseries{formula} for the sum!  

\begin{theorem}{Arithmetic Series Formula}  Let $a_n$ be an \series{arithmetic} sequence with initial term $a_0$ and common difference $d$.  Then the following sum has closed form $$\sum_{n=0}^N a_n = \left(N+1\right)\cdot\frac{a_0+\left(a_0+Nd\right)}{2}. $$
\end{theorem}

A nice short way to state the \area{arithmetic series formula} is as follows: 
\begin{center}
\emph{The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the number of terms times the average of the first term and the last term.}\end{center}

$$\sum_{n=1}^N n=\sum_{n=0}^N n=(N+1)\cdot\frac{a_0+(a_0+Nd)}{2}=\frac{(N+1)(0+0+N(1)}{2}=\frac{(N+1)(N)}{2}.$$ Note that we can equate the first two sums because the zero term at the front of the series doesn't contribute anything to the total.\\}{1in}

\begin{example}{Adding Multiples of Six }
Suppose we wish to find the sum of all multiples of six between 1000 and 2000.  We notice that neither 1000 nor 2000 are divisible by six. However, multiples of six can never be too far away.  In particular, $1002=6\cdot167$ and $1998=6\cdot 333$.  Thus, the summation we wish to evaluate is $$1002+1008+1014+\cdots+1998 $$ which can also be written as $$6\cdot167+6\cdot168+6\cdot169+\cdots+6\cdot333. $$  From the above forms, we now have all the information we need to apply the Arithmetic Series Formula.
\begin{itemize}
\item First Term: $1002$
\item Last Term: $1998$
\item Number of Terms, Remembering the Fencepost: $333-167+1=167$

We now evaluate the summation using the Arithmetic Series Formula as follows: \begin{align*}
1002+1008+1014+\cdots+1998 &=\left(\text{Number of Terms}\right)\left(\text{Average of First and Last}\right)\\

\begin{example}{Difference of Two Quartics Formula}  Here we show how the geometric series formula can be used to obtain a factorization formula!  In particular, let us evaluate the summation $$A^3+A^2B+AB^2+B^3.$$  We follow the little remark above, noting that the first term is $\left(A^3\right)$ and the common ratio is $\left(B/A\right)$.

where GSF stands for Geometric Series Formula.  We now use it to evaluate the general summation.

$$\sum_{n=0}^N 3^n=\left(1\right)\left(\frac{1-3^{N+1}}{1-3}\right)=\left(\frac{1-3^{N+1}}{-2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(3^{N+1}-1\right)$$
Thus, the model predicts that after $N$ generations, there are $\frac{1}{2}\left(3^{N+1}-1\right)$ total critters in the family tree.

\item In the above example, why was it valid to use the Geometric Series Formula? 
\solushun{Since each generation produces 3 times as many offspring as it has members, there is a common ratio of 3 in the series $1+3+3^2+\cdots+3^N$. Thus, we can use the geometric series formula.\\}{.3in}
\item In the above example, plug in $N=0,1,2$, and 3 into the formula $\frac{1}{2}\left(3^{N+1}-1\right)$ and verify that it produces the correct totals.
\solushun{
\begin{align*}
    N=0 & \frac{1}{2}\left(3^{0+1}-1\right)= \frac{1}{2}3-1)=1\\
    N=1 & \frac{1}{2}\left(3^{1+1}-1\right)= \frac{1}{2}(9-1)=4\\
    N=2 & \frac{1}{2}\left(3^{2+1}-1\right)= \frac{1}{2}(27-1)=13\\
    N=3 & \frac{1}{2}\left(3^{3+1}-1\right)= \frac{1}{2}(81-1)=40.\\
\end{align*} These value all agree with the table.\\

\item The above example demonstrates that the quantity $3^{N+1}-1$ is always divisible by 2.  Why is this the case?
\solushun{Every term of the sum except the first is a power of three. So, if we ignore the first term, the sum is always an odd number. When we add back the first term, we get an even number.\\}{.5in}

Economists often use Geometric Series when studying economic activity.  The exercise below is related to the idea of the \emph{velocity of money}, a measurement of how quickly money gets re-spent as it is received.  

\begin{exercise}{Velocity of Money \Coffeecup \Coffeecup } Let us a consider a simple model of income and spending.  People on average spend 80\% of what income they receive.  For example, say a contractor earns \$100,000 for a building job.  He then spends 80\% of this on a fancy automobile. Collectively, the car salesman, dealership, and auto manufacturer receive \$80,000.  They in turn go spend 80\% of that \$80,000 on going out to dinner, reinvestment in their business, or other goods and services that are then received as income by others.  Thus, these others will receive \$64,000 which they in turn will again go out and spend 80\% of.  


Suppose also that on average, money changes hands roughly once a month.  That is, there is a one-month delay between receiving money as income and going out to spend it. 


The government invests \$5 billion in public infrastructure.  How much total economic activity is actually generated by this investment in one year? Use the Geometric Series Formula to evaluate your answer!

\solushun{
We start by considering what the series sum might look like. If we take each month's expenditure as a term in the series, we get
$$5\text{ billion} + 0.8\cdot 5\text{ billion} + 0.8^2\cdot 5\text{ billion} +\cdots + 0.8^12\cdot 5\text{ billion}.$$ So the first term in the series is $5\text{ billion}$, the common ration is $0.8$, and the number of terms is $13$. Plugging this into the GSF we get$$\$5 \text{ billion }\cdot\frac{1-0.8^{13}}{1-0.8}\approx \$23.6 \text{ billion}.$$

Here is an example that will initially look out of place in this section.  We will later see why this is in fact geometric series in disguise!  

\begin{exercise}{\fibonacci{Partial Sums} of Fibonacci Numbers \Coffeecup \Coffeecup \Coffeecup}\label{Lieonacci}
Recall $F_n$, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Compute the following quantities:
\begin{align*}
F_0&=\\
F_0+F_1&=\\
F_0+F_1+F_2&=\\
F_0+F_1+F_2+F_3&=\\

\end{align*}

\item Explain why $F_0+F_1+\cdots+F_N$ cannot be evaluated by directly applying the Arithmetic or Geometric Series Formula.

\solushun{The series is neither arithmetic, as it has no common difference, nor geometric, as it has no common ratio.\\}{.5in}

\item Do you notice any patterns in the sums above?  In particular, see if you can express the sum of Fibonacci numbers $\sum_{i=0}^n F_i$ in terms of just a single Fibonacci number.

\solushun{Each sum is one less than the value of the next Fibonacci number. For example, $F_0=0=F_1-1$, and $F_0+F_1+F_2+F_3=4=F_4-1$. So, $$\sum_{i=0}^n F_i=F_{n+1}-1.$$\\}{1in}

We don't have the tools at the moment to prove that formula is correct, but we will revisit this example in Chapter \ref{FigAndGnocchiNumbers}.
